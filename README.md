# Chess-Review
I am trying to create a chess review system similar to chess.com which can review my games, as well as hopefully look at my previous games in order to give me hints and common mistakes in my play

Also planning to depending on your opening you can drill some games with the same opening, from the games in your database, by logging the mistakes and blunders, I can easily save the position using FEN and then place you into those positions, so that you can improve your logic
